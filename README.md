Main requirements:
- Adafruit Trinket M0
- MG995R servo
- Micro usb data capable cable
- 5V(>=2A) power supply ideally, (but probably not below 5V(1A) due to the 1.2A stall current draw of the servo)
- 6 - Steel Socket Head Screw, 10-32 Thread Size, 1" Long
- 4 - Steel Socket Head Screw, 10-32 Thread Size, 1/2" Long
- 10 - Steel Square Nut, 10-32 Thread Size
- 6 - Steel Socket Head Screw, 4-40 Thread Size, 7/8" Long
- 6 - Steel Square Nut, 4-40 Thread Size
- Misc wire, soldering equipment, etc
- A file might be needed, depending on the resolution/capabilities of your 3d printer
- Some strapping material, silicone/rubber bands, velcro straps, etc to strap things to the three holders

The design of the gears provides a linear travel distance of roughly 3 to 4.5 inches depending on the servo's ability to rotate 120 to 180 degrees.
